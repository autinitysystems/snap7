snap7
=====

CMake based fork of [Snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/).

LIMITATIONS
-----------

Currently there are some limitations derived from the original snap7:
 * On Windows only MSVC is supported
 * Only shared libraries can be built

We also removed Solaris support for now to make the porting to cmake easier.
